# Weekly Picks Screen Implementation & Debugging Summary

## 1. Feature Implementation
- **Created `WeeklyPicks.jsx`**: New page for users to view weekly picks.
- **Dropdown for Collections**: Reused logic from `Picks.jsx` to fetch and display week collections (e.g., `odds_YYYY_MM_DD`).
- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - If user has made all 3 picks for a week, show all users' picks for that week.
  - If not, show a message prompting the user to make all 3 picks.
- **Table Layout**: Added a table with columns for User, Game, Pick, Spread/Total, and Score (placeholder for future scores).

## 2. Backend Changes
- **/api/picks Route**:
  - Updated GET and POST logic to use `userId` as a string (Firebase UID), not a MongoDB ObjectId.
  - Ensured all queries and inserts use the string UID for consistency.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Removed all uses of `new ObjectId(userId)` for picks.
  - Updated query logic to match on string `userId`.

## 3. Data Migration
- **Migrated Existing Picks**:
  - Updated all documents in the `picks` collection so `userId` is the Firebase UID string, not an ObjectId.
  - Used a script to match each pick's `userId` (ObjectId) to the corresponding user's `firebaseUid` and update the field.

## 4. Frontend Fixes
- **Pick Submission**:
  - Ensured the frontend sends `userId: currentUser.uid` (Firebase UID string) when submitting picks, not `currentUser._id`.
- **Table Rendering**:
  - Fixed React warning by removing whitespace and comments between `<tr>` and `<td>`/`<th>` in the picks table.

## 5. Debugging Steps
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Fixed by removing ObjectId conversion for Firebase UIDs.
- **No Data Displayed**: Fixed by migrating data and ensuring consistent use of string UIDs.
- **React DOM Warning**: Fixed by cleaning up table markup in `WeeklyPicks.jsx`.

## 6. Recommendations
- **Always use Firebase UID string for user identification in picks.**
- **Remove any legacy code that uses MongoDB ObjectId for userId in picks.**
- **Document this convention for future development.**
